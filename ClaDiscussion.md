# Introduction #

Development for UDA4PHP takes place under a Contributor's License Agreementâ€”we believe that this will offer everyone an added layer of protection and, hopefully, stimulate greater cooperation by commercial interests that would otherwise be concerned about possible legal liability.

## Legal Framework ##

From a legal perspective, the project is managed and owned by [[Blue Parabola LLC](http://blueparabola.com)], a consulting firm organized under the laws of Delaware.

Blue Parabola only acts as the legal umbrella for the project; its technical direction is managed by the developers, and the end product is and will remain free and open source software. BP has pledged not to interfere with the project except in circumstances where a particular decision would place BP itself in legal jeopardy.

## Picking a CLA ##

As of December, 2008, we are in the process of deciding on a CLA for the project. The team has settled on using the [[Mozilla CLA](http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/)], with some slight changes.

The CLA is available [[here](ClaDocument.md)], and can be discussed on the project's [[Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/uda-for-php)].
